This is a repository of the Research Papers that I've read, replicated, and written

Check the papers read directory for the papers that I've read. 

I've also replicated a few papers, the code for which I will soon upload:
- How to GAN LHC Events
- ParticleNet
- Skip GANomaly
- DCGAN
- Pix2Pix
- CNN based particle physics representations
